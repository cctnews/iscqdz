　　假戏也能催人泪，实情不动假慈爱。所以，很多功夫自顾自的的演着独角戏。一句句猖狂的开场白，冲动了本人。绑缚了终身的情绪，在经久不息中积淀成了钻心的痛。
　　说句实在话，我是不愿意把医院看着生死的驿站，更不愿意把医生看着是货物收发员，或者修理厂里的维修工人。大病而忘的终局纯属天意，对此我有精神准备，不会怨天怨地的。我不愿意看见的，是因了人为缘由，把森严的等级痕迹和自视清高的权威气氛，肆意涂抹在生死驿站的空间里，让病人和亲友一看见医生就条件反射般地心悸胆怯，以至于面对医疗措施的设置，虚高的治疗费用和指令性的价格标准，甚至医生的一个眼神和嘴里冒出来的一个音符，除了毕恭毕敬的执行之外，还是毕恭毕敬的执行。曾经在幽幽暗暗反反复复中冥想，终于破译出原来最简单的草枯草荣就是一种玄奥，那是生命的直观道具：花只能红一次，草只能绿一季。逝者如斯，又有什么必要去计较生与死、卑与尊呢？又何必在乎森严的等级痕迹和自视清高的权威气氛呢？森严的等级痕迹和自视清高的权威气氛是暂时的，被淹没了的生死驿站的真实面目，终归是要浮出水面的，这是人性回归的必然。
	5、真爱就和鬼一样，总是听别人遇到。
But we are not similar funny people, there is no chance to meet more in civilians have such lovely anonymous wise men.
I believe that in the serious deformation characters of the republic of China, must also have a lot of humor.
However, what I call "fun" is a kind of lively and rare personality, I don't know what words to define it, the effect of it, it is not just funny, funny, cute, its inner strength is much greater than we can imagine.
Fun, fun, not even with deadly force, Hitler finally defeat to Churchill, because Hitler is not a "fun";
Because Chiang kai-shek to MAO zedong, Chiang kai-shek does not understand the "fun" - fun people know self-mockery, know the kind, he always relaxed, open-minded, game.
"Fun", is the personality and the fate of the side of the room for large, rich and generous background, once the correct serious fun, once fierce anger, once initiated to, do not know the fun, can suffer.
What I like now.
Oh.
A donkey.
Have you ever seen a compared himself to a donkey?
I don't think so.
I am a simpleton.
But I just feel myself like a donkey, I was wearing a mask, millstone around ah ah, I don't know what.
I only feel dizzy.
The stars scattered, gastrointestinal, but I don't know why.
